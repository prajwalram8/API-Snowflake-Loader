### 1. REST API Data Ingestion Tool


**Configurability:**
- The tool should allow configuration of REST API endpoints, headers, query parameters, and payload.
- Users should be able to set the API call frequency and timing.

**Incremental Load:**
- The tool must store the state of the last load (e.g., the last ID retrieved or the timestamp of the last update).
- It should allow for incremental data fetch based on this state.

**Resilience:**
- The tool must handle HTTP errors gracefully and implement retry logic.
- It should manage API rate limiting with backoff strategies.

**Scalability:**
- The system should be able to process large datasets, possibly by implementing chunking or streaming of data.
- It should support concurrent processing if multiple APIs or tables are involved.

**Security:**
- API keys and Snowflake credentials should be stored securely, potentially using environment variables or encrypted files.
- Sensitive information must never be hard-coded.

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- Comprehensive logging for all operations, including errors and successful loads.
- Alerting mechanisms for critical failures.

**Transformation:**
- Basic data transformation capabilities to match Snowflake schema requirements.
- Conversion of JSON response data into a tabular format suitable for Snowflake.

**Snowflake Integration:**
- The tool should support different Snowflake authentication methods (user/password, OAuth, etc.).
- It must be able to create and manage tables and stages within Snowflake.

**Pagination and Rate Limiting:**
- The tool must handle pagination in API responses.
- It should respect API rate limits and possibly adjust the fetch frequency accordingly.

### 2. Design of the Framework

Based on the requirements, here's an outline of the key components:

- **APIHandler**: Manages API requests, handling authentication, pagination, and rate limiting.
- **DataProcessor**: Transforms API response data into the format required by Snowflake.
- **StateManager**: Tracks the state of data loads for incremental updates.
- **Scheduler**: Schedules API calls and data loads.
- **CredentialManager**: Securely handles credentials and secrets.
- **SnowflakeLoader**: Manages connections to Snowflake and executes data load operations.
- **Logger**: Implements logging across the system.
- **AlertManager**: Sends notifications in case of failures or significant events.

### 3. Project Structure Enhancement

Based on the design, we could enhance the initial structure:

```
data_ingestion_tool/
|-- api/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- api_handler.py
|-- data_processor/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- data_processor.py
|-- state_manager/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- state_manager.py
|-- scheduler/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- scheduler.py
|-- credentials/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- credential_manager.py
|-- db/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- snowflake_loader.py
|-- utils/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- logger.py
|   |-- alert_manager.py
|   |-- config_manager.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- ...
|-- main.py
|-- requirements.txt
|-- .env.example
|-- README.md
```

### 4. Code Support

For each component, we will write Python classes or modules that handle their respective tasks. For example:

- `api_handler.py` will manage API calls using the `requests` library.
- `data_processor.py` will parse and transform JSON responses into a format suitable for database insertion.
- `state_manager.py` will keep track of the last record fetched to ensure incremental loads.
- `snowflake_loader.py` will use `snowflake-connector-python` to manage Snowflake operations.

### Next Steps

The next step is to start with the project setup:

- Initialize a new Python project and create a virtual environment.
- Set up the project directory structure.
- Create placeholder files for each of the components.
- Start defining the classes and methods based on the project design.
